## Project Overview 📋  
Manager is in need of someone who can assist him to help his restaurant stay afloat.  
The restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation.

Manager and maeketing department wants the answers to a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns,  
how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite to deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

**I would be assisting their business by providing insights and recommendations on the basis of the restaurant's data.**
